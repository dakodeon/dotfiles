* MY CONFIG FILES

** OVERVIEW
This repository contains configuration files for some programs that I frequently use. There are also some scripts that make my life somewhat easier...
The approach that I decided to take is to place all these files together and then link them to the correct path.
This is currently under construction, for now I am just experimenting with this idea. I also want to write a script that will link the files to the correct path automatically.

Configured programs: i3, ranger, zsh, urxvt (with Xresources)
Scripts: mount/unmount management, bulk MP3 renaming according to ID3 tags, python script to shutdown i3 (unused)

** FILES AND LOCATIONS
"i3/config" "$HOME/.i3/config"
"i3/i3blocks.conf" "$HOME/.i3/i3blocks.conf"
"i3/i3blocks_scripts/*" "$HOME/.i3/i3blocks_scripts/*"
"ranger/*" "$HOME/.config/ranger/*"
"scripts/*" "$HOME/.config/scripts"
"zshrc" "$HOME/.zshrc"
"Xresources" "$HOME/.Xresources"

Note that the scripts directory must be added to your path
