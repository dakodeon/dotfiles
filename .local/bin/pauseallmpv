# Note: For this to work you need the mpvSockets script from
# https://github.com/wis/mpvSockets

# stolen from LukeSmith and modified

# You might notice all mpv commands are aliased to have this input-ipc-server
# thing. That's just for this particular command, which allows us to pause
# every single one of them with one command! This is bound to super + shift + p
# (with other things) by default and is used in some other places.
