# Mount - unmount. Wraps mnt and umnt

# The way it works

# It looks up for unmounted and mounted devices. If only mounted devices found,
# immediately calls umnt. If only unmounted devices found, immediately calls
# mnt. If both are detected, prompts the user.

# For more, see 'mnt -h' and 'umnt -h'
