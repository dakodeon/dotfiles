* MY DOTFILES (PERSONAL CONFIGURATION)

A repository that will gradually contain all of my basic config files.

I followed this guide: https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/

The repository is stored in a directory named =.dotfiles= in my home folder.
